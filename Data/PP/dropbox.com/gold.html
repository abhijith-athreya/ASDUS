    <p> WE DON'T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN'T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU.

    <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
    <p> . We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Let's Try To Sort Things Out First</h2>
    <p> . You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn't affect those requirements.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Judicial forum for disputes</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h2>
    <p> . You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this "Mandatory Arbitration Provisions" section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>We Both Agree To Arbitrate</h2>
    <p> . You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account. However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
    <p> clicking here</p>
    <p> . The (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Arbitration Procedures</h2>
    <p> American Arbitration Association</p>
    <p> . The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Arbitration Fees and Incentives</h2>
    <p> . Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
    <p> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Mandatory Arbitration Provisions" section will be deemed void.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>NO CLASS ACTIONS</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>Controlling Law</h2>
    <p> These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Waiver, Severability & Assignment</h2>
    <p> Dropbox's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p> We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>
    <p> (a) changes to the law,</p>
    <p> (b) new regulatory requirements, or</p>
    <p> (c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p>
    <p> If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we'll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p>

Where applicable, we'll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>

    <p> Data Processing</p>

    <p> EU Standard Contractual Clauses</p>
    <p> . Dropbox may update the Services from time to time. If Dropbox changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, Dropbox will notify Customer at the email address associate with the account, and Customer may provide notice within thirty days of the change to terminate the Agreement. This termination right will not apply to updates made to features provided on a beta or evaluation basis.</p>
    <p> Modifications</p>
    <p> . The Services allow Customer and End Users to download Software that may update automatically. If any component of the Software is offered under an open source license, Dropbox will make the license available to Customer and to the extent the provisions of that license grant Customer additional rights, those provisions will expressly override some terms of this Agreement with respect to that component of the Software.</p>
    <p> . Dropbox hereby grants to Customer during the Term a limited non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with the Services and in accordance with this Agreement.

    <p> Customer Administration of the Services</p>
    <p> . Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.

    <p> Unauthorized Use or Access</p>
    <p> . Customer will not: (a) sell, resell, or lease the Services or Software; (b) use the Services or Software for activities where use or failure of the Services or Software could lead to physical damage, death, or personal injury; (c) reverse engineer the Services or Software, or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless this restriction is prohibited by law; or (d) use the Services or Software, including the export or re-export of Customer Data, in violation of Export Control Laws.</p>
    <p> Restrictions</p>
    <p> . Customer and its End Users must use the Services in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer is responsible for use of the Services by its End Users. Customer will comply with laws and regulations applicable to Customer's use of the Services, if any. Customer will obtain and maintain from End Users any consents necessary to allow Administrators to engage in the activities described in this Agreement and to allow Dropbox to provide the Services. Customer will not store, transmit or otherwise process any information via the Services that falls within the definition of "Protected Health Information" under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R. Section 164.051), unless Customer and Dropbox separately enter into a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, which may be done via the Admin Console.</p>
    <p> .

Dropbox will make commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third-Party Request, to: (i) promptly notify Customer of Dropbox's receipt of a Third-Party Request; (ii) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third-Party Request; and (iii) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third-Party Request, if Customer is otherwise unable to obtain the information. If Customer fails to promptly respond to any Third-Party Request, then Dropbox may, but will not be obligated to do so.</p>
    <p> Dropbox Responsibility</p>
    <p> . Customer will pay Dropbox or Customer's Reseller all applicable Fees for the Services, in the currency indicated on the Order Form. Customer authorizes Dropbox, or Customer's reseller, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer's selected payment method. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.</p>
    <p> . Customer will pay Dropbox invoices on the payment interval set forth in the Order Form. Dropbox may suspend or terminate the Services if Fees are past due. Customer will provide complete and accurate billing and contact information to Dropbox or to Customer's Reseller.</p>
    <p> . Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all Taxes. Dropbox, or Customer's reseller, will charge Taxes when required to do so. If Customer provides Dropbox or its reseller with a valid exemption certificate, Dropbox or the reseller will not collect the taxes covered by that certificate.</p>
    <p> . Customer will pay Dropbox or its reseller net of any applicable Withholding Taxes. Customer and Dropbox, or Customer's reseller as applicable, will work together to avoid any Withholding Tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If Dropbox or Customer's reseller qualifies for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, Dropbox or Customer's reseller will provide Customer with reasonable documentary proof. Customer will provide Dropbox or Customer's reseller reasonable evidence that it has paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>
    <p> Withholding Taxes</p>
    <p> . IF THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO-RENEWAL OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD, DROPBOX (OR THE CUSTOMER'S RESELLER) MAY CHARGE AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS THE CUSTOMER NOTIFIES DROPBOX (OR THE CUSTOMER'S RESELLER, AS APPLICABLE) THAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL. Dropbox may revise Service rates by providing the Customer at least thirty days' notice prior to the next charge.</p>
    <p> Auto-renewals and Trials</p>
    <p> . If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer: (i) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase; and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to this Agreement and are null and void. If the Customer is purchasing via a reseller, any terms and conditions from the Customer's reseller or in a purchase order between the Customer and its reseller that conflict with the Agreement are null and void.</p>
    <p> Purchase Orders</p>
    <p> . If an End User: (a) violates this Agreement; or (b) uses the Services in a manner that Dropbox reasonably believes will cause it liability, then Dropbox may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account. If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, then Dropbox may do so.</p>
    <p> Of End User Accounts by Dropbox</p>
    <p> . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a Security Emergency then Dropbox may automatically suspend use of the Services. Dropbox will make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or terminate the Security Emergency.</p>

    <p> Intellectual Property Rights</p>
    <p> . Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant: (a) Dropbox any Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data; or (b) Customer any Intellectual Property Rights in the Services or Dropbox trademarks and brand features.</p>
    <p> Reservation of Rights</p>

    <p> .
