    <h2>1. Who We Are?</h2>
    <p> Kia is a subsidiary of Kia Motors Corporation, which is based in Seoul, South Korea. We are the exclusive distributor of Kia-branded motor vehicles, parts, and accessories in the United States. Our “dealers” and “licensees” are independent companies that sell our vehicles, parts, and accessories, and are licensed to operate such businesses using the trade names, trademarks, and service marks owned by us or our affiliates. Our “business partners” are independent companies that we contract with to provide you with or offer you other services and products. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to dealers, licensees, and business partners collectively as “.” This Privacy Policy governs only Kia’s privacy practices. It does not govern the privacy practices of our Partners, even when you connect to their websites from the Services and when their websites or communications are co-branded with Kia trademarks. To learn about the privacy practices of our Partners, please review the privacy policies of each of those Partners. However, if a Partner shares information with us (including when you purchase a vehicle from a dealer and when your Kia vehicle is serviced by a dealer), this Privacy Policy will apply to our collection and use of such shared information.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Partners</h2>
    <p> Our “” include our parent company(ies), subsidiaries, sister companies, and affiliated companies. As described below, we may share information that we collect with our Affiliates. Our Affiliates may have their own privacy policies that govern their treatment of information that you provide to them directly or that they collect when you use their websites, applications, or other services. For example, Kia customers who have financed or leased a Kia vehicle through Kia Motors Finance will be subject to Kia Motors Finance’s own privacy policy (and terms of use) with respect to the information collected via Kia Motors Finance’s websites, applications, and other services.</p>
