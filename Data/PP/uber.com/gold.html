    </hr>
    <h2>Information you provide</h2>
    <p> This includes information submitted when you:</p>
    <p> Create or update your Uber account, which depending on your location and the Uber services you use may include your name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, payment or banking information, government identification numbers, birth date, and photo</p>
    <p> Submit information about your vehicle or insurance (for driver partners)</p>

    <h2>Information created when you use our services</h2>
    <p> This includes:</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Location Information</h2>
    <p> Depending on the Uber services that you use, and your app settings or device permissions, Uber may collect your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, IP address and WiFi.</p>
    <p> If you are a driver or delivery partner, Uber collects location information when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on screen) of your device.</p>
    <p> If you are a rider, Uber may collect location information when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions, Uber may also collect this information when the Uber app is running in the background of your device if this collection is enabled through your app settings or device permissions.</p>
    <p> Riders and delivery recipients may use the Uber app without enabling Uber to collect their location information. However, this may affect the functionality available on your Uber app. For example, if you do not enable Uber to collect your location information, you will have to manually enter your pickup address. In addition, location information will be collected from the driver partner during your trip, even if you have not enabled Uber to collect your location information.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Transaction Information</h2>
    <p> We collect transaction details related to your use of our services, including the type of services you requested or provided, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details.

    </hr>

    <p> We enable users to call or text each other through the Uber apps.

To provide this service, Uber receives some information regarding the calls or texts, including the date and time of the call/text, and the content of the text messages.
