<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>1. General Statement:</b></u></p>
<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This privacy statement explains our policies and practices regarding online customer information. It is through this disclosure that we intend to provide you with a level of comfort and confidence in how we collect, use, and safeguard personal and other information we collect or that you provide through this website, and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. It is our sincere hope that by explaining our data handling practices we will develop a trusting and long-lasting relationship with you. By using the site, you agree to the terms of this privacy statement. For information regarding the data that Vehicle Health Report and SYNC Services (where equipped) collect from you to provide you with these services, see&nbsp;<a href="https://owner.ford.com/tools/account/sync-terms-and-conditions.html" target="_blank" title="Terms and Conditions.">Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>2. Information About Our Organization and Website and General Data Collection Practices:</b></u></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to www.Ford.com and its related mobile site, and to www.Owner.Ford.com (collectively referenced herein as “site” or “website”) which are owned by Ford Motor Company, Marketing, Sales and Service Division, 16800 Executive Plaza Drive, Dearborn, MI 48126. Ford.com also contains certain micro-sites which may be administered by a third-party on behalf of Ford such as warriorsinpink.com.</p>
<p><b>Ford.com</b></p>
<p>The business purpose of the Ford.com website is to provide visitors: (1) with knowledge of the features and benefits of the complete line of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks; (2) with purchasing-related information such as available incentives, services, product inventory and dealership contacts; (3) the ability to save and share certain content that is of interest to you such as your favorite vehicles, technologies, and photos and videos; (4) the opportunity to enter sweepstakes and purchase items; and (5) the opportunity to share your story regarding a Ford Motor Company product.</p>
<p>On certain portions on Ford.com, you may have the opportunity to request information or a contact from your local dealer through various shopping tools. These shopping tools include Build and Price, Search Dealer Inventory, Incentives and Offers, Request a Local Quote, and Trade-in Value. When you provide your personally identifiable information in those instances, it is collected by FordDirect, an independent company that assists our dealers. If you choose to provide your personally identifiable information to FordDirect, please note that it will be subject to the FordDirect Privacy Policy located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forddirectprivacy.com/" target="_blank" title="http://www.forddirectprivacy.com/.">http://www.forddirectprivacy.com/.</a></p>
<p>Certain features that are available on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank" title="www.ford.com">www.ford.com</a>&nbsp;may not be available on the related mobile site and vice versa.</p>
<p><b><br>
Owner.Ford.com</b></p>
<p>The business purpose of Owner.Ford.com is to provide Ford and Mercury vehicle owners a web destination that aggregates resources for convenience, savings, and vehicle maintenance. Owner.Ford.com provides access to vehicle and dealer information, discounts, coupons, service rebates, service history tracking, and SYNC product information, including SYNC software and support documentation. Also, where applicable, this site provides owners the ability to manage your SYNC Services and Vehicle Health Report accounts including setting various preferences, track Owner Advantage Rewards account(s), and access Ford Extended Service Plan information and purchase processing.</p>
<p>For added convenience, a select set of site features are accessible from web-enabled mobile devices as a mobile-optimized web experience. These site features may be limited in functionality.</p>
<p><u><b><br>
Online Tracking Information</b></u></p>
<p>When you visit this site other parties such as third-party advertising partners and analytics providers may collect information about your digital activity over time and across digital platforms.

For more information about third-party advertising partners’ collection and use of such data for interest-based advertising purposes (and opting out of such use), see “Interest-Based Advertising” in Section 7.</p>
<p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, Ford Motor Company does not currently respond to undefined “DNT” signals to its US websites.</p>
<p>Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some functions or services on our sites.</p>

<p><u><b>7. Methods to Collect Information:</b></u></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.</p>
<p>This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a product or service, including items from our online store. In performing this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your purchase.</p>
<p>This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and Mouseflow) to capture clickthrough statistics. These parties may collect information about your use of the site and across different sites and mobile apps, and across devices over time.</p>
<p>This site may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came, the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to this site via banner ads, site links or QR Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.</p>
<p>Users you may be provided the opportunity to integrate with third-party social media sites, and this site may track on an aggregate level the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p><u><b><br>
Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising</b></u></p>
<p><u>Interest-Based Advertising.</u>&nbsp;On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies, web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and combine it with information collected from other websites, apps or other digital services) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you interact with other (non-Ford) sites, mobile apps or digital services within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising".</p>
<p>Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices in the footer of the page.</p>
<p><u><br>
Opting out</u></p>
<p>Note: The process to opt-out of interest-based advertising is different for web browsers and mobile apps.</p>
<p><u>1. Opting out on website pages.</u>&nbsp;If you do not want your online browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link in the footer to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s). An opt-out applies only to the device and browser in use at the time of opting out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. See the following paragraph to learn more about how opting out works. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<p><u>1a. Opt-out Compliance Service for interest-based advertisements.</u>&nbsp;This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Ghostery assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (now generally known as interest-based advertising) managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" title="(http://www.aboutads.info).">(http://www.aboutads.info).</a>&nbsp;When you opt-out on site pages, or through such advertisements, Ghostery conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt-out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again. The list of our advertising partners that place cookies on this website may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies and to learn more about interest-based advertising, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" title="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</a></p>
<p><u>2. Opting out of in App interest-based advertisements.</u>&nbsp;iOS and Android mobile device users, and possibly users of other mobile devices, may control in App advertisements by disabling or resetting the mobile device advertiser ID.
