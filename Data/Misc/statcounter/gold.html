    <h2>1. Visiting a Website that uses StatCounter Analytics</h2>
    <p> If you visit a site that is using the StatCounter Analytics service, the following cookies will usually be set on your computer.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>3rd Party Unique/Returning Cookie (is_unique)</h2>
    <p> This holds data on your visits to websites which use StatCounter. We solely use it to determine whether you are a first-time or returning visitor on each website and to estimate your accumulated unique visits per site. No personal information is stored in the cookie.</p>
    <p> Duration: 5 years</p>
    <p> Set by: statcounter.com</p>
    <p> Note: This method is being phased out (2016) in favour of 1st party cookies:</p>
    <p> 1st Party Visitor Cookie (sc_is_visitor_unique)</p>
    <p> This cookie is set by the website that you visit. When it is first set, a random id is generated and stored in the cookie in order to avoid counting you as a visitor more than once (e.g. if you are on a mobile device and your IP address changes while you browse). Similarly to the is_unique cookie, this cookie also stores a count of your returning visits.</p>
    <p> Duration: 2 years</p>
    <p> Set by: member website</p>
    <p> Introduced: 2014, in widespread use: mid 2016</p>
