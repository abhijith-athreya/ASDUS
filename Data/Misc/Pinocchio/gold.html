    <h2>A Boy Made of Wood</h2>
    <p> Long ago in Italy there lived on old clock-maker named Geppetto. Beep-beep-TICK! Beep-beep-TOCK! went all the clocks in his shop. When he worked, Geppetto felt happy. But when he rested, a sad feeling came over him. “Ah!” he would think. “All my life and no child to call my own!”</p>
    <p> One day Geppetto carved a puppet from wood in the shape of a boy. The arms and legs could move easily. He cut and sewed a nice outfit for the puppet, as if it were a real boy. That night, Geppetto lay the puppet down onto the bed.</p>
    <p> From out of the window, a big star twinkled bright.</p>
    <p> “Bright star,” said Geppetto. “If I could make one wish, it would be I could have a real boy of my own.” But of course, he knew that was not possible.</p>

    <h2>From out the window, a big star twinkled bright.</h2>
    <p> That night, the same big star swooshed right into Geppetto’s window. It changed into a Blue Fairy, who flew over to the bed.</p>
    <p> “Little wood puppet,” said the Blue Fairy. “In the morning, you will be able to walk and talk like a real boy.” She tapped the puppet one time with her wand. “And if you can prove that you are brave and true, someday you will be a real boy.”</p>
    <p> Pinocchio’s eyes opened.</p>
    <p> “One more thing,” said the Blue Fairy. Suddenly. a cricket appeared. And not just any cricket, a big cricket! He was dressed mighty fine -and even could talk! “Meet the Cricket", said the Blue Fairy. He will stay with you to help you make good choices.” And with that, the Blue Fairy was a star again. Swoosh! You could see her out of the window in the night sky.</p>
    <p> When Geppetto woke up the next morning, he said, “I will go take my puppet out of bed.” But the puppet was gone!</p>
    <p> “Here I am, Father!” said Pinocchio from the other side of the room.</p>
    <p> Geppetto swung around. “What? You can talk?”</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“Here I am, Father!”</h2>
    <p> “Yep! I am Pinocchio, your boy!”</p>
    <p> “How could this be?” said Geppetto in shock. Then he said, “But who cares?” He rushed over and swept the puppet into his arms. “Pinocchio, my son!” he said in great happiness.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Off to School</h2>
    <p> One day Pinocchio said, “I want to go to school, like other boys.”</p>
    <p> “Of course you do,” said Geppetto. But he did not have the money to buy schoolbooks.</p>
    <p> Later that day, Geppetto came back home. “Here are your books,” said he. “You can go to school tomorrow!”</p>
    <p> “Oh, boy!” said Pinocchio. “But where is your warm coat, Father?”</p>
    <p> With a wave of his hand Geppetto said, “No need to care about that. What matters is that you will go to school!” He did not want Pinocchio to know he had traded his warm coat to buy the schoolbooks.</p>
    <p> The next morning, Pinocchio said good-bye to Geppetto. He skipped along the path to school, humming as he went. The Cricket rode on his shoulder, happy, too.</p>
    <p> Coming up to them on the path was a Fox and a Cat.</p>
    <p> “And where are you going on this fine day?” said the Fox.</p>
    <p> “I am going to school!” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> Coming up to them on the path was a Fox and a Cat.</p>
    <p> “On such a day as this?” said the Fox. “It is too nice to be stuck inside! You should come with us, to the fair.”</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“But I’m going to school!” said Pinocchio.</h2>
    <p> “Listen to me,” said the Fox. He put his arm around Pinocchio’s shoulder. “Anything you need to know, you can learn better at the fair.”</p>
    <p> “Really?” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> “Take it from me,” said the Fox.</p>
    <p> “Pinocchio, he does not know what he is talking about!” said the Cricket.</p>
    <p> The Fox covered the Cricket with his hat. No one could hear the little fellow as he tried to call out, “Pinocchio, do not listen to him!”</p>
    <p> “Okay!” said Pinocchio. And they headed off to the fair.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The Fair</h2>
    <p> What a fair it was! By the gate was a man dressed all in white. He called out, “Come in, come in! Right this way! Get your tickets here!”</p>
    <p> With a sad look Pinocchio said to the Fox and Cat, “I do not have a ticket.”</p>
    <p> A man was selling old things at a table near the gate. He called, “Hey, you! Sell me those new schoolbooks of yours! That is how you can get money for a ticket.”</p>
    <p> The fair was so happy and bright and colorful, that the next thing Pinocchio knew he had sold his schoolbooks for a ticket.</p>
    <p> “No, Pinocchio, stop!” called the Cricket, who finally got out from under the Fox’s hat. But Pinocchio, the Fox and Cat did not hear. They were already inside the fair.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The Man Who Ran the Fair</h2>
    <p> On stage was a puppet show! “I am a puppet, too! I can dance like that!” said Pinocchio. He jumped right onto the stage and started to dance with the other puppets.</p>
    <p> “Look at that puppet!” someone called. “It has no strings!”</p>
    <p> “No strings?” said another. “Amazing!”</p>
    <p> Everyone laughed and laughed. They threw coins on the stage.</p>
    <p> The man who ran the fair saw coins fly onto the stage. “Well, now!” he said, rubbing his chin. “This puppet with no strings will make me rich!”</p>
    <p> The next thing Pinocchio knew, he was picked up and thrown in a birdcage. In the next moment, the door was locked shut.</p>
    <p> “Hey, get me out!” called Pinocchio. But the person who had thrown him in just left the room. Only the Cricket heard his calls. The Cricket ran in and out of the birdcage, but the lock stayed shut.</p>
    <p> “I will never go to school now!” cried Pinocchio.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The Nose Grows</h2>
    <p> All of a sudden, poof! There was the Blue Fairy.</p>
    <p> “Please!” said Pinocchio. “Can you help me?”</p>
    <p> “Tell me something first,” said the Blue Fairy. “How did you get inside that cage?”</p>
    <p> “Tell her what happened,” said the Cricket.</p>
    <p> “Well, I…” Pinocchio stopped. But could he really tell the Blue Fairy what had happened? What would she think of him?</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“Tell me something first,” said the Blue Fairy. “How did you get inside that cage?”</h2>
    <p> “Um, I was robbed,” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> “Is that right?” said the Blue Fairy with a frown. Pinocchio’s nose began to grow.</p>
    <p> “Yes, robbed!” said Pinocchio. “By three mean men – no, four!”</p>
    <p> The nose grew more.</p>
    <p> “They took my books. And threw me into this cage!”</p>
    <p> More and more his nose grew. Until Pinocchio could see nothing in front of his face but one big wide nose.</p>
    <p> “What’s happened to my nose?” Pinocchio cried out.</p>
    <p> “Pinocchio!” said the Blue Fairy in a stern voice. “You must know what the truth really is.”</p>
    <p> “I guess so,” said Pinocchio. “I came to the fair with a Fox and Cat.”</p>
    <p> The nose got shorter.</p>
    <p> “I had to sell my books to get a ticket.”</p>
    <p> “Had to?” said the Blue Fairy.</p>
    <p> “I mean, I decided to sell my books to get a ticket,” said he.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The nose got shorter.</h2>
    <p> The nose got shorter still.</p>
    <p> “Then someone put me in this cage,” he said.</p>
    <p> The nose was back to normal. “Good job, Pinocchio!” said the Cricket.</p>
    <p> “Well done,” said the Blue Fairy. “Now I will get you out of here.”</p>
    <p> With a wave of her wand, Pinocchio was outside the cage.</p>
    <p> “Here are your books.” And Pinocchio was holding schoolbooks in his hands again.</p>
    <p> “Know this,” said the Blue Fairy, “you are on your own from now on. Make sure you do the right thing.” And she was gone.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The Coachman</h2>
    <p> A Coachman drove up to Pinocchio, who was back on the road to school. “Hey kid, how about a ride?”</p>
    <p> “No, thank you,” said Pinocchio. “I am going to school.”</p>
    <p> “You will ride faster with me,” said the Coachman to Pinocchio. He said to himself, “He will ride faster all right, but not to where he thinks he is going!”</p>
    <p> When Pinocchio was inside the coach, the Coachman said, “Say kid, why do you think boys like you go to school?”</p>
    <p> “To learn things,” said Pinocchio. “And grow up, I guess.”</p>
    <p> “Well,” said the Coachman, “what if I told you that could do whatever you want, right away?”</p>
    <p> “Right away?”</p>
    <p> “Yep! Think of it. Skip the schoolbooks. Skip the tests. Right now, you could have all the candy you can eat! Ice cream of every flavor. Ever want to smoke a cigar or play pool? All this and more, at Pleasure Island.”</p>
    <p> “Pleasure Island?”</p>
    <p> “Best place in the world for boys like you!”</p>
    <p> “Don’t listen to him, Pinocchio!” shouted the Cricket.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Best place in the world for boys like you!”</h2>
    <p> “Why wait?” said the Coachman. “I know just where Pleasure Island is. This is your lucky day, kid. So what do you say?”</p>
    <p> “Let’s go there!” said Pinocchio. “I’m going to Pleasure Island!”</p>
    <p> “Augh!” said the Cricket, his arms in the air.</p>
    <p> “Good move,” said the Coachman. He turned around the coach, and they sped off.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Pleasure Island</h2>
    <p> “You got a boy with you in that coach?” said a dark stranger to the Coachman.</p>
    <p> “Yep.” The Coachman grabbed Pinocchio and threw him onto the ground. “He’s all yours. Now pay up.”</p>
    <p> The Coachman reached out for something (was it money?) from the dark stranger. Then the Coachman drove off.</p>
    <p> What could it all mean? But as Pinocchio looked around, he no longer cared. For everything the Coachman had told him was true! Heaps of candy all about. Tubs of ice cream in every flavor. None of the boys had to work or clean up. There were even cigars if you wanted one, and pool tables.</p>
    <p> What fun! But after a few days, something was odd. “Where did all the boys go?” he asked the Cricket.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“I must say, there used to be more boys around here,” said the Cricket.</h2>
    <p> “All I see now is donkeys,” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> “I must say, there used to be more boys around here,” said the Cricket.</p>
    <p> Just then, one of his ears popped into a donkey ear. His other ear popped into a donkey ear, too.</p>
    <p> “Oh!” cried the Cricket. “What is happening to you?”</p>
    <p> “I don’t know.- HONK!” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> Then Pinocchio and the Cricket saw a line of donkeys led by a dark stranger onto a truck. “Oh, no!” said the Cricket. “Now I get it! Boys are turned into donkeys here. Then the donkeys are sold! Pinocchio, we have to get you one of here - fast!”</p>
    <p> “Let’s go – HONK!” said Pinocchio. His two feet popped into four.</p>
    <p> “Run, quick!” said the Cricket. One good thing about Pinocchio’s new four legs is that he could run very fast! Quick, quick, they ran out of Pleasure Island. Soon they were at a dock by the ocean.</p>
    <p> “Please sir!” Pinocchio called out to a man by the dock. “I am looking for an old man named Geppetto. Do you know him? – HONK!”</p>
    <p> “Sounds like you are getting a bad cold,” said the old man. “Hmm, Geppetto. That’s the old man whose son left one morning and did not come back. He went out on a boat to look for him. No one has seen the poor fellow since.”</p>
    <p> “Oh no! This is all my fault – HONK!” said Pinocchio. “I must look for him!” Pinocchio jumped over the dock into the ocean. The Cricket jumped in too, close behind.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>The Whale</h2>
    <p> Most of Pinocchio was still made of wood, so he could float on the ocean. “Father!” he called out. “Father!” but there was no answer.</p>
    <p> All Pinocchio could see around him was blue water, everywhere. Until – what was that far away? Something was rushing up. Something very big, and fast!</p>
    <p> In a moment, a giant whale was upon them. It opened its giant jaws and with one gulp, swallowed Pinocchio! Rushing inside with all the sea water tumbled Pinocchio and the Cricket. When they came to a stop, they saw that they were in the dark belly of the whale.</p>
    <p> “Are you okay?” said Pinocchio to the Cricket.</p>
    <p> “I am fine,” said a voice of an old man.</p>
    <p> “Wait a minute,” said Pinocchio. “Father, is that you?”</p>
    <p> There was Geppetto!</p>
    <p> “Father, Father, it’s me!” said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p> “My son!” said Geppetto. “I thought I was dreaming!”</p>
    <p> They hugged in joy.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“Father, Father, it’s me!” said Pinocchio.</h2>
    <p> “Look!” said Geppetto as three fish swam by. “There goes dinner!”</p>
    <p> “Father, I have an idea. Let’s make a fire.”</p>
    <p> “Grilled fish!” said Geppetto.</p>
    <p> “No, I mean for us to get out!” said Pinocchio. He gathered driftwood and got a flame going. “This is how we can make the whale sneeze!” He waved his arms over the flame to make a lot of smoke. Soon, clouds of black smoke were rising up.</p>
    <p> The whale gave a cough. “Hang on!” said Pinocchio. And then… WAM!! In one big sneeze, Pinocchio, Geppetto and the Cricket flew out of the whale’s mouth. Rolling over in the sea water, at last they were rolled up onto dry shore.</p>
    <p> “Pinocchio?” Geppetto rose to his feet. The Cricket was there, but where was Pinocchio?</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>“Hang on!” said Geppetto.</h2>
    <p> And then they found him! He was face down, his head in a puddle.</p>
    <p> “Pinocchio!”</p>
    <p> But it was too late. Geppetto and the Cricket wept over Pinocchio, the boy puppet, who lay still in the water.</p>
