    <p> We need to unlearn the assumption that suffering is always clearly visible to us, so that we can better understand and help those who struggle with illnesses that go unseen. Here are some signs that someone might have hidden depression.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>1. They might not “look depressed”</h2>
    <p> Due to media and cultural stereotypes, most of us have assumptions about how someone behaves and looks if they’re struggling with depression. We imagine someone who rarely leaves their room, doesn’t dress themselves well, and constantly looks miserable, but people with depression do not all behave in the same way.</p>
    <p> All people are, of course, different from each other, and the symptoms and coping abilities of people with depression also differ. Many are able to keep up a facade of good mental health to protect themselves, but they aren’t suffering any less simply because they can do this. Similarly, those who are unable to keep up such a facade are not “weaker” than those who can.</p>

    <h2>2. They may often seem exhausted or complain about always being tired</h2>
    <p> A prevalent side effect of depression is constant exhaustion. Not everyone with the disorder struggles with it, but it’s extremely common. For those who experience this symptom with their depression, it’s often one of the hardest side effects to cope with.</p>
    <p> Also, if someone is living with an undiagnosed depression disorder, the cause of their exhaustion can be baffling. They can get plenty of sleep each night and still wake up every morning feeling like they only slept a few hours. Worse, they may blame themselves, believing it to be laziness or some other personal fault that’s causing their low energy levels.</p>
    <p> This is also a symptom that’s difficult to conceal for those who have been diagnosed with depression but are attempting to keep it from their peers, as it often affects their workload and personal relationships.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>3. They can be unusually irritable</h2>
    <p> A depressed person’s behavior might be interpreted as melancholy even if that’s not what they’re really feeling. Irritability is a frequently overlooked symptom of depression that is also very common. This should be understandable, since depression is a health problem you can’t “see” or strictly measure, making it hard to combat.</p>
    <p> The constant work it takes to keep up all the necessary aspects of life while dealing with depression also drains the person, and leaves little room for patience or understanding.</p>
    <p> If someone you know discovers they’re clinically depressed and shares this with you, you may initially be confused if their previous behavior didn’t fit the common misconception of the shy, silent depressed person. If they tend to have a short temper and are quick to annoy, that’s actually a side effect of depression.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>4. They could have a tough time responding to affection and concern</h2>
    <p> The main misconception about depression, which has been hinted at in the paragraphs above, is that it’s about “feeling” sad.</p>
    <p> On the contrary, depression is mostly not feeling anything, or only partially and briefly experiencing emotions. It depends on the individual, but some people with depression report feeling almost “numb,” and the closest thing to an emotion they experience is a kind of sadness and/or irritation.</p>
    <p> Because of this, appropriately responding to gestures or words of affection will be difficult for them, or they just don’t think about it any more.</p>
    <p> They may even get irrationally irritated or annoyed with you over it, because it may simply be too difficult for their brains to process and respond to your loving gestures.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>5. They might frequently turn down activities they used to love or would otherwise enjoy</h2>
    <p> Unless other explanations could equally be possible, an uncharacteristic lack of interest in activities over an extended period of time could be a sign that someone has depression. As mentioned above, depression is just as physically draining as it is mentally draining, which makes enjoying all the things you usually do difficult.</p>
    <p> Previously-loved activities can even lose their appeal in general, because depression also commonly makes it difficult to enjoy or feel fulfilled by much at all. If you have no other way of explaining their decreasing interest, it could be a symptom of clinical depression.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>6. They can develop abnormal eating habits</h2>
    <p> Abnormal eating habits mainly develop for two reasons: as a form of coping, or as a side effect of lack of self-care. Eating too little or too much is a common sign of depression. Overeating is often shamed the most, when food can be the one source of pleasure a depressed person is able to give themselves and thus causes them to eat excessively.</p>
    <p> When a depressed person is eating too little, it’s often because their depression is affecting their appetite and making eating unappealing. It can also be a subconscious need to control something, since they cannot control their depression. If someone is undiagnosed or has not shared that they have depression, people will assume their eating habits are a personal fault and judge them for it, making the person feel worse.</p>

    <h2>7. They may start needing more from you</h2>
    <p> A depressed person legitimately can’t function like a mentally health person. There will be things they will no longer be able to do as much of, as often, or at all. Pestering or shaming them about it will only hurt, not help. If they’ve been keeping their depression private, it will be that much harder to deal with others getting irritated with them because they can’t perform at the level that’s expected of mentally healthy people.</p>
    <p> This is why it’s always best to be understanding with those in your life, both work and personal. You don’t know if someone isn’t just slacking off, but is struggling with a real health problem.</p>

    <h2>8. They can have bad days, and “better” days</h2>
    <p> Depression can have its ups and downs. If someone has hidden or undiagnosed depression, they might seem like they get random mood swings, depending on if their depression is consistent or not. To you (and to them, if they are undiagnosed), the changes in mood seem without cause, but it’s simply how some people’s depression manifests.</p>
    <p> If you know the person has depression, it’s possible to falsely believe they’re permanently better because of a few “good” days. While it’s always great if someone has a day that’s better than the one before it, you should always let them tell you what they’re ready to handle and when.</p>
    <p> Assuming they’ve completely recovered and pushing them too quickly into things might overwhelm them and make them retreat into themselves again. Be supportive of your friends and family who have depression, but let make the calls.</p>

    <h2>1. Mood Alternator</h2>
    <p> The act of having sex is obviously pleasurable, but did you know it transcends the physical and affects you emotionally too? Studies show that people who have sex frequently have an elevated mood and a reduction in symptoms of depression. But why? Believe it or not, this is partly due to the body’s exposure to semen. Yep, it’s true! Contact with semen brings a jolt to a woman’s system because it is a source of many mood-altering compounds. Compiled of endorphins, oxytocin, serotonin, and prolactin, a woman’s vaginal tissue absorbs the semen’s mood-elevating chemicals to turn your tense and unhappy mood into a calm and happy one.</p>
    <p> Who knew sex could feel so good – emotionally?</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>2. Stress Reliever</h2>
    <p> Not only does having sex make you feel better, it also acts a stress reliever and lowers your blood pressure. Research indicates that people who engage in frequent sex have lower blood pressure than those who are not sexually active. The oxygenation of blood pulls the mind away from negative stressors and releases feel-good hormones to activate pleasure centers in the brain. In suspended animation, your mind and body simultaneously go off-grid for a moment in time. Upon return, you remain in a state of relaxation and tranquility.</p>
    <p> There’s nothing better than feeling stress-free and satisfied, right?</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>3. Pain Reducer</h2>
    <p> Regardless of how much we try to stay healthy, there’s always that headache, foot, or back pain that creeps up on us after a long day at work. The last thing on our minds is having sex. What if I told you that’s exactly what you should do? As a natural pain reliever, studies prove that having sex can help ease any annoying ache or pain. The rush of oxytocin right before you climax and the endorphins released during an orgasm trigger receptors in the brain. Similar to the effects of morphine, presence of an object inside the vagina instinctively reduces pain by increasing tolerance. Females would not be able to give birth to babies without this mechanism.</p>
    <p> Wow! Talk about flipping the script!</p>

    <h2>4. Productive Periods</h2>
    <p> This unexpected health benefit of sex is targeted at the ladies. Gentlemen, don’t fret – you can certainly benefit from this too. No one is a fan of Mother Nature and her inopportune timing for delivering her monthly gift. Unfortunately, the package has to be delivered. What if it came with fewer cramps and lighter cycles? That’s right, people! The more frequent the orgasms, the fewer cramps and less time spent feeling miserable! Women who have a healthy sexual appetite experience more orgasms and shorter periods. Why? Thank sex for that. Let me explain. Frequent orgasms encourage a woman’s uterus to contract, eliminating and riding her body of cramp-causing compounds. Ergo, increasing the number of uterine contractions helps expel blood and tissue quicker, aiding in shortening her period.</p>
    <p> Stress reliever, pain reducer, and now period producer – who knew sex was so beneficial?</p>

    <h2>5. System Strengthener</h2>
    <p> There’s no excuse for you to fear getting sick and not going out this season – there’s only a solution. To protect your body from contracting a cold or getting sick, increase the number of times you have sex to strengthen your immune system. Research shows that people who have sex one to two times a week have three times as much Immunoglobulin A in their system when compared to those who do not frequently have sex. Immunoglobulin A is a major and significant antibody to help combat disease and protect the body from catching the flu.</p>
    <p> Yes, you read that correctly – having sex helps strengthen your immune system.</p>

    <h2>6. Smart Sex</h2>
    <p> If you are going to take my advice, you are obviously smart. I’m not trying to be funny – I’m just giving you the facts. It’s undeniable that sex has physical and emotional benefits, but what about psychologically? Well, it’s been proven that having sex enhances the blood flow with the body and brain. Delivering an extra-boost of glucose after your orgasm, your body converts it into energy, giving you the focus you need to stay productive.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>7. Sincere Skin</h2>
    <p> With a significant increase in oxygenation and circulation of the blood, a post-coital glow means a temporary brighter complexion thanks to last night’s training session. Orgasms trigger a rush of endorphins and growth hormones into your body to help heal damage caused by the sun, smoking, and cortisol build-up. However, the best health benefit of having sex is long-lasting, if not beautiful. Studies indicate that people who have sex every other day look dramatically younger than their less sexually active peers by at least seven to 12 years!</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8. Sex Appeal</h2>
    <p> Sex is a great mode of exercise because it takes both physical and psychological work to do it well. Just so we’re clear: sex does count as cardio! Engaging a personal (of course private!) training session can help you burn anywhere from 85 to 250 calories, depending on the level and length of time you spend “working out.” Furthermore, cardiologists have said to consider sexual activity comparable to a modest workout on a treadmill.</p>
