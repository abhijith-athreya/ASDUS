    <h2>Terms and conditions governing your use of the press release distribution and related service(s) (collectively, the “Service”):</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>1. Use</h2>
    <p> A. You are responsible for the content and accuracy of all news copy and other information submitted by you to Vocus PRW Holdings, LLC d/b/a PRWeb (“PRWeb”) or entered into the Service (the “Submitted Materials”) even if such copy has been reviewed, edited or written by PRWeb for you. Because of the volume of information and copy submitted to PRWeb, PRWeb cannot be responsible for verifying facts contained in Submitted Materials. All Submitted Materials must follow PRWeb’s editorial guidelines which can be found on PRWeb’s web site and are subject to change at any time at PRWeb’s sole discretion.</p>
    <p> B. PRWeb reserves the right (i) to reject or edit Submitted Materials, provided that substantive edits to the Submitted Materials will not be done without your consent; and (ii) to remove any press release from its web site, pull any press release from distribution or deny approval to any press release. PRWeb can only remove Submitted Materials from its network, and PRWeb makes no representation or warranty regarding the removal of Submitted Materials from sites outside of the PRWeb network.</p>
    <p> C. PRWeb endeavors to disseminate Submitted Materials promptly and accurately. Any inadvertent errors by PRWeb will be corrected promptly upon discovery, without additional charge, and such obligation to correct shall constitute the sole liability of PRWeb in this regard. If Submitted Material is not distributed within 30 days of the earlier of the (i) date on which you enter such material or (ii) pay for the Service (even if you have not yet entered Submitted Material) for reasons other than a delay caused solely by PRWeb, then PRWeb’s service to you concerning such Submitted Material and/or payment shall be considered complete, and PRWeb shall have no further obligation to you regarding such Submitted Material or in relation to such payment.</p>
    <p> D. All Submitted Materials transmitted by PRWeb must contain a user-supplied contact name, phone number and e-mail address that may be verified by PRWeb.</p>
    <p> E. PRWeb does not warrant specific placement of any news release nor pick up by third parties of any news release on its wire, but will deliver a news release via online distribution methods to make such content available to be repurposed by third parties who discover the content at various Internet locations, both intended and unintended.</p>
    <p> F. You agree to use the Service for its intended purpose and not for any illicit purposes including, but not limited to, the reverse engineering of the site and/or its processes and the inclusion of such processes or services in a derivative service. You shall not query, spider or access any PRWeb systems without the express written consent of PRWeb.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>2. Suspension, Termination</h2>
    <p> A. PRWeb may suspend or terminate your account at any time at its discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your account becomes delinquent or you breach any material term or condition herein, then, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, PRWeb reserves the right to suspend your access to the Service, without liability to you.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>3. Billing</h2>
    <p> A. You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.

PRWeb reserves the right to modify its fees and charges and to introduce new charges at any time.</p>
    <p> B.

    <p> A. You represent and warrant to PRWeb that (i) you have the right to deliver the Submitted Materials to PRWeb, (ii) you will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and laws relating to “spam”, (iii) Submitted Materials will not contain any content that is obscene, libelous, slanderous or otherwise defamatory, false or misleading or which violates any copyright, right of privacy or publicity or other right of any person; and (iv) Submitted Materials will not contain any viruses, scripts, macros, or programs or links to macros, scripts, programs, or any code that alters, destroys, infiltrates or inhibits the operation of computer systems including, but not limited to the Service or data stored within such computer systems including, but not limited to the Service.</p>

IN NO EVENT SHALL PRWEB HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DEMANDS OF THIRD PARTIES OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
