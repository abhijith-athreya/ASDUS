    <h2>Binding Contract</h2>
    <p> These Use Terms are a contract between you and us and govern your WooCommerce Service use. Agreeing to these Use Terms is a condition of any WooCommerce Service use. You signify your agreement to these Use Terms and are legally bound by them from the date on which you:</p>
    <p> Click to accept or agree to these Use Terms where WooCommerce presents an option to do so, either on the Website or otherwise; or</p>

    <h2>CPA Application</h2>
    <p> A “transaction” (as defined in the CPA) between you and us may or may not fall under the provisions of the CPA depending upon whether certain of our Customer’s threshold values are below a certain value at the time the transaction is entered into.</p>
    <p> The threshold values relate to a Customer’s asset value or annual turnover, and the value against which they are measured is as determined by the Minister of Trade and Industry by publication in the Government Gazette from time to time.</p>
    <p> Our duties towards you may vary depending upon whether the transaction in question is subject to the CPA, and we will rely on information you give us in order to determine whether the CPA applies. Consequently:</p>
    <p> You warrant that any statement you make to us regarding relevant threshold values is accurate.</p>
    <p> We may require you to provide us with the supporting financial statements as proof of any threshold values which you may represent as being below the relevant values, or in the event it appears that the CPA applies to our contract with you in the form of these Use Terms.</p>
    <p> You agree that for any losses we sustain as a result, if you misrepresent any threshold values and we are subsequently penalised as a result of our reliance on your misrepresentations, .</p>

You further agree that it is your responsibility to review these Use Terms regularly in the event that we do publish a notice of proposed changes.
