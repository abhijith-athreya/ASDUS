You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works or in any way exploit any of the Content (including Content that the Sites enable you to download or save) without our express permission.</p>
    <p> Here’s what permission we do give you to use the Content. First, we give you permission to use the Content to surf and view our Sites, which means displaying or loading the Content on your computer in connection with typical web browsing activity. Second, we give you permission to use the Content for your personal, non-commercial uses.

(We intend these only as examples and are not an exhaustive list of things you can’t do with our Content).</p>

    </hr>
    <h2>A. YOUR USE OF USER GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
    <p> It’s great that users on our Sites can upload or share content with each other, but we do not authorize you to upload or share on our Sites certain items and content. Do not create, transfer, share, send, submit, post or upload any User Generated Content that:</p>

    <p> If you post, upload or make available any User Generated Content on our Sites, you will still own the User Generated Content (assuming you have rights to own it) but you are giving us the right to use your User Generated Content. If you create, transfer, share, send, submit, post or upload any User Generated Content to our Sites, you grant us certain rights to use it (described below) without getting your further permission or having to pay you for it.</p>
    <p> In legal terms, by transferring, sharing, sending, submitting, posting, uploading or making available User Generated Content on these Sites, you grant SIEA a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and fully sub-licensable license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, store, and create derivative works from your User Generated Content, in any form, format or medium of any kind now known or later developed, both on these Sites and other online locations, and in other forms or media off the Internet.

    <p> SIEA may or may not pre-screen User Generated Content. SIEA has the right (but not the obligation) to move, remove, block, edit, or refuse to post any User Generated Content for any reason, including that User Generated Content violates these Terms of Service or other applicable terms, rules or agreements between you and us.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>D. RISK FROM USER GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
    <p> We cannot and do not monitor or manage all User Generated Content.

In other words, enjoy what other members post or share, but do it at your own risk.</p>
    <p> All User Generated Content made available on the Sites is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it. This means that you are entirely responsible for all User Generated Content that you provide.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>6. YOUR COPYRIGHTED WORK</h2>
    <p> Just as Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC (“SIEA”) requires users of our Sites to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and business partners, we respect the copyrights of others. To that end, we have adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“Copyright Act”) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).</p>
    <p> Once SIEA’s representative who has been designated to receive notification of claimed copyright infringement (“Designated Agent”) – whose name and contact information is noted below – receives proper notice of the alleged infringement, or if SIEA otherwise comes to believe in good faith that any specific content, including user generated content, on the Sites contain material that infringes copyright (“Disputed Content”), SIEA may (1) promptly remove or block access to the Disputed Content or (2) deny access to the Sites to users that repeatedly violate copyright or other intellectual property rights. SIEA will take reasonable steps to notify a user who has uploaded Disputed Content if that Disputed Content is subsequently removed or disabled.</p>
    <p> Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringement</p>
    <p> If you believe in good faith that your copyrighted work has been reproduced on the Site without authorization in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you or a person authorized to act on your behalf may notify our Designated Agent:</p>
    <p> Jennifer Liu Legal & Business Affairs Department Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC 2207 Bridgepointe Pkwy San Mateo, CA 94404 By phone: 1-800-345-7669 By email:</p>
    <p> SIE-copyright@am.sony.com</p>
    <p> Pursuant to federal law, your notice must include the following information:</p>
    <p> 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that you alleged is being infringed;</p>
    <p> 2. Identification of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the Site are included in a single notification, a representative list of all those works on the Site;</p>
    <p> 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
    <p> 4. Your contact information, including address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;</p>
    <p> 5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SIEA is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right under the Copyright Act that is allegedly infringed.</p>
    <p> Supplying a Counter-Notice Regarding Alleged Copyright Infringement</p>
    <p> If you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included in Paragraph 1 above). The counter notification must provide the following information:</p>
    <p> 1. Physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;</p>
    <p> 2. Identification of the Disputed Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location where the Disputed Content appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</p>
    <p> 3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the Disputed Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;</p>
    <p> 4. Your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address; and</p>
    <p> 5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SIEA is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</p>
    <p> If our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, SIEA will send a copy of it to the original complaining party informing that person or entity that SIEA may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it. Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notice to any party other than the complaining party.</p>
    <p> Unless the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, SIEA will replace or restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to re-post the Disputed Content.</p>
