All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>
    <p> Age Requirements. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18years old and that you possess the legal right and ability to enter into this Agreement and to use the ADWEEK Applications in accordance with these Terms. If we have any reason to believe you are not 18 or older we may terminate your access to the ADWEEK Applications and Content.</p>
    <p> Availability and Use Outside the U.S. Unless otherwise specified, the Content on any ADWEEK Application is presented solely for the purpose of promoting publications and other products available in the United States, its territories, possessions and protectorates. ADWEEK makes no representation that any Content on any ADWEEK Application is appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use any of the Websites from a location outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with applicable U.S. and local laws, including export and import laws. Those who choose to access any ADWEEK Application from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for establishing the usability or correctness of any information or Content under any or all jurisdictions and the compliance of that Content with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>
    <p> Violations of this Agreement; Injunctive Relief. ADWEEK reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of this Agreement, including without limitation the right to block access to the ADWEEK Applications from a particular account, device or IP address. ADWEEK shall not be liable for any damages of any nature suffered by any customer, user, or any third party resulting in whole or in part from ADWEEK’s exercise or its rights under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that the Content is highly proprietary material in nature and that unauthorized copying, transfer or use may cause ADWEEK irreparable injury that cannot be adequately compensated for by means of monetary damages. You agree that any breach of this Agreement by you may be enforced by ADWEEK by means of equitable relief (including, but not limited to, injunctive relief) in addition to any other available rights and remedies.</p>
    <p> Termination. On termination of your registration account or Subscription, all usage rights to the Content automatically terminate, and you shall immediately cease to use the Content and shall remove any and all electronic copies of the Content from your systems.</p>
    <p> Usage by children under 13. The ADWEEK Applications are directed to adults and are not directed to children under the age of 13. ADWEEK cannot prohibit minors from visiting our websites so ADWEEK must rely on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervising children under 13 to decide which materials are appropriate for such children to view and/or purchase. ADWEEK complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and does not permit registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you are not at least eighteen years old, you represent that you are using the Websites with parental consent</p>
    <p> Other. This Agreement, including any schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. ADWEEK may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the continuation or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. The waiver by ADWEEK of a breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent or other breach or violation. The failure of ADWEEK to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of ADWEEK of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by ADWEEK or be deemed a waiver by ADWEEK of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of ADWEEK under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and ADWEEK shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit ADWEEK’s right to exercise any other right or remedy.</p>
