     Premium Services
    </h2>
    <p>
     Generally, creating up to two (2) sites is free. A website comes with 1GB
storage and a limit of 5MB per individual file upload. On free Sites, Yola
reserves the right to include the Yola promotional link on your Site. As a
User, you can also purchase one or more Premium Services from us. Today,
Premium Services include various options such as registering your own domain
name, private domain registration, email for that domain, and one of our
premium service bundles that contain one or more of: a top-level domain,
additional tiers of storage, larger file uploads, access to premium styles,
access to premium support, advanced analytics and third party credits. The
categories and prices of our Premium Services are described
     <a href="file:///C:/pricing">
      here
     </a>
     and are subject to change from time to time. Yola
may choose to temporarily change the fees for the Premium Services for
promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when
Yola posts the temporary promotional event or new service on the Yola
Platform. Any changes to fees for Premium Services that are not temporary or
promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with
notice by posting such changes on Yola.com. Unless otherwise stated, all fees
are quoted in U.S. Dollars.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Payment Generally
    </h2>
    <p>
     You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated
with the Premium Services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. You
authorize Yola to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal,
or financial institution account (herein "Payment Method") for all
charges to your accounts with Yola. Your Payment Method will be charged the
current fee for the Premium Service you choose on the date that you click on
the "Purchase" button in the ordering process. Our offerings
include Premium Services payable by recurring payments. You agree that Yola
may automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of
each recurring period (or up to 30 days prior to expiry for domains). For
example, if you choose a Premium Service with a monthly plan, you will be
billed every month on the anniversary date of the date you clicked the
"Purchase" button. In the case of domains, you may be billed up to
30 days BEFORE your domain expires - this will vary depending on the Domain
Registrar's terms of renewal (these terms are not governed by Yola).
Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium
Services ("Pre-Payment Plan"). If you opt for Pre-Payment plan,
your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Premium
Service at the commencement of each renewal period.
     <br>
     <br>
     In all instances, you acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related
billing and payment information that you provide to Yola may be shared by
Yola with companies who work on Yola's behalf, such as payment
processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit,
effecting payment to Yola and servicing your account. The terms of your
payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by
agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment
Method. You agree to pay Yola all charges incurred under your account for any
Premium Service in which you or anyone else who uses your account (including
children, family and friends) enroll in accordance with this Agreement and
any applicable Premium Services policies. If your Payment Method fails or
your account is past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your
account upon demand, (b) Yola may collect fees owed using other collection
mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and
(c) Yola reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium
Services or your account with Yola, including deletion of your Website from
Yola.com. Except as may be set forth herein, any fees charged to your account
are non-refundable. Payments made with boleto bancario are non-refundable.
You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in
writing to Yola within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such
dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to
challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to such dispute, are at the
discretion of Yola.

     Money-Back Guarantee
    </h2>
    <p>
     Yola provides both free and paid services to Users. Most paid services
include a 30-day money-back guarantee, except payments made with boleto
bancario are non-refundable. If you are dissatisfied with your service for
any reason, you will receive a refund if you cancel your paid services within
30 days of the activation of your account. The 30-day money-back guarantee
does NOT apply to domain name registration, other domain name services, Yola
Premier, Yola Gold, Fotolia Image credits, and for already
redeemed credits. Once you register your domain name or apply your domain
credit, it cannot be "returned" until the duration of the domain
term has expired. However, we can assist you in transferring or pointing your
domain to the host of your choice. The amount of your refund will be the
price of the paid service you purchased from Yola minus domain name
registration fee and overage charges, and minus the value of any redeemed
credits. If the value of the credits you have redeemed exceeds the price of
the paid service, then you will not receive a refund.
