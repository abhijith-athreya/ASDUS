In some cases, Chegg may provide salary ranges for jobs, and point users to potential job opportunities in that field, based upon your interests and skills that you have represented to Chegg that you possess. Chegg may also help identify skills that are commonly required for those jobs, and recommend learning materials that (combined with your own efforts) may help you achieve better proficiency with those skills. Chegg's attempts to assess your skills, identify gaps, and match those gaps to available learning materials may not be accurate in your particular circumstances. Chegg is simply one starting point, not an exhaustive list of all potential jobs or opportunities that might be available to you, and in a fast changing employment landscape Chegg does not guarantee that the descriptions, salaries and job opportunities set out on our site are always up to date, reflect the current job market, or are applicable to the market in your area. We believe that the materials on our site, if you use them and apply yourself, can improve your skills and employability. Still, Chegg does not provide in depth, individualize job counseling, and your success in landing a job in a particular career depends on a wide variety of factors. Our system's efforts to identify skills gaps, and recommend learning materials to address those gaps, may not result in improved employment prospects; completing recommended classes is in not a guarantee of finding employment in that field, or any other field.</p>
    <p> Chegg may also help students or alumni find internships or entry level jobs or other positions by accepting postings of job descriptions from third party employers, through its Internships.com website or other Chegg Websites. Chegg does not confirm the accuracy of the postings, nor can Chegg know whether a particular position has been filled. Chegg may recommend particular job postings to particular users based upon available data about the position or the user, or other criteria, but the actual criteria for job positions lie within the discretion of the employer and Chegg makes no representations about the suitability of any candidate for any listed position.</p>

    <h2>Learning Courses</h2>

We do not control such materials and, as such, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, do not guarantee their reliability, validity, accuracy or truthfulness. Completing such courses may provide you with skills and experience that may help your career prospects, but as noted above, there are a large number of factors tied to your career and completing such courses is no guarantee of improved employability or enhanced career prospects.</p>

    <h2>Reporting Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Violations</h2>
    <p> Chegg respects the intellectual property rights of others and takes the protection of copyrights and other intellectual property seriously. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you believe your work has been infringed through the Services, please notify us at or at Chegg, Inc., Attention: Copyright Agent, 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara CA 95054, and provide the following information:</p>
    <p> Your contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</p>
    <p> A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed (including, e.g., the title, ISBN and other bibliographic information for books);</p>
    <p> A reasonably specific description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on the Services (including, e.g., the URL);</p>
    <p> A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the allegedly infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</p>
    <p> Your electronic or physical signature;</p>
    <p> A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and</p>
    <p> Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party.</p>
    <p> NOTE: This contact information is for inquiries regarding potential copyright and other infringement only.</p>
    <p> It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.</p>
    <p> Chegg will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of the third party's intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p> IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT MATERIAL IS OR IS NOT INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES. THESE INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED BY CHEGG, BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER, OR BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER'S LICENSEE THAT IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF RELIANCE UPON YOUR MISREPRESENTATION. YOU MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY. You agree we may provide your notice to the provider of the allegedly infringing material.</p>
    <p> We have a policy of terminating accounts of users who repeatedly and intentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Legal Disputes</h2>
    <p> If a dispute arises between you and Chegg, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Services or your use of the Services (a " ") in accordance with the subsections below.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p> You and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, " ") will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court. Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Disputes if you provide Chegg with written notice of your desire to do so by email at or regular mail at our offices located at Chegg, Inc., 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: General Counsel within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Use (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you do not provide Chegg with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts. Further, unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Legal Disputes" section will be deemed void. This "Legal Disputes" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.</p>

    </hr>
    <h2>You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</h2>
    <p> Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (" ") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the " ") then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use. (The AAA Rules are available at or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>AAA</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>AAA Rules</h2>
    <p> www.adr.org/arb_med</p>
    <p> . A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides forms for use in arbitration proceedings including a Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules .) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
    <p> Arbitration Process</p>
    <p> . Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
    <p> Arbitration Location and Procedure</p>
    <p> . The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Chegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
    <p> Arbitrator's Decision</p>
    <p> . Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Chegg will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
    <p> . If Chegg changes this Legal Disputes section, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to ) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Chegg in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the date you first accepted the terms of these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>
    <p> This "Legal Disputes" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>

    <h2>Policies</h2>
    <p> When using the Services, you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to features you use through the Services, including without limitation the and all policies referenced in the General Policies or elsewhere in this Agreement.

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p> Please refer to our Privacy Policy (www.chegg.com/privacypolicy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>List Prices</h2>
    <p> The list prices displayed on the Services for publications come from bibliographic information we receive from leading third-party sources and publishers. Each list price is the publisher's suggested retail price. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg is not responsible for errors in that third-party data, including prices for the sale or purchase (buyback) of books. If a title does not have a publisher's suggested list price, the Services may not show a list price in the online catalog. If a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in pricing information received from our suppliers or for any other reason, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or debit card charged. If your credit or debit card has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your credit or debit card account.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Chegg Credit</h2>
    <p> From time to time, Chegg may issue you "Chegg Credit." Upon providing you Chegg Credit, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg may place limits on its use, and Chegg Credit may not be moved from one Chegg Service to another. If provided to you in exchange for goods or services or as a refund, it will not expire, though we may with notice after a posted period of time convert your credit to cash and send it to your address of record. If the credit was given to you with terms explicitly authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash. If you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons, Loyalty Programs, Points Programs & Other Promotions</h2>
    <p> From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional incentives. These incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion). You are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions and limitations. You agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion, smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system. By participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code has expired). All promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients. Discounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or purchase cost; they do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Return of Digital Access Codes</h2>
    <p> Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content. The DAC publishers allow only one user (one activation) of these codes. Chegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging. If the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold. Thus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Tax</h2>
    <p> Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many states. Depending on your state and the nature of the product or service you receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax and/or use tax. Tax rates are different from state to state. You are responsible for paying all such taxes.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Supplemental Materials</h2>
    <p> Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals. However, they are available for purchase on select titles. If you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it. We ask that you return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Asset Ownership</h2>
    <p> All rentals remain the property of Chegg even while the item is in your possession. You may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle. If you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option. In this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your credit or debit card is approved for purchase value. If you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we provide the book to the shipping company. Certain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Certain Payments and Renewals</h2>
    <p> Payment for certain Services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually). . Also, for some of our paid Services, you may elect to temporarily "suspend" your membership, for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s). You agree to pay all applicable fees for your memberships and use of our paid Services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable. All fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation, unless otherwise disclosed at the time of purchase. If you wish to cancel your membership in a Service (if available), please visit the customer support web area on the Services.

    <h2>Free Trial Memberships</h2>
    <p> We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services. Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence. Users that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise. You can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Chegg's customer support. After cancellation of a free trial, you may be able to continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access. Only one free trial membership is allowed per person. Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials. Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first. We may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>Chegg Honor Code</h2>
    <p> We know that most of you have never and will never abuse the Services or any of the information, services or materials available through them. You agree to abide by our Honor Code.</p>
    <p> You may not use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information available on or through the Services, to cheat. Examples include:</p>
    <p> 1. Submitting any textbook solutions from the Services as your own to any class. 2. Using our questions and answers service to complete tests or homework when instructed not to use outside help. 3. Otherwise passing along any solutions, answers, materials or information from the Services as your own. 4. Any other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.</p>
    <p> We will take swift action against anyone found violating this Honor Code. If Chegg is presented with evidence that its Services have been used in a manner contrary to its Honor Code or any other part of these Terms of Use, Chegg may, in its sole discretion, remove the materials and terminate the account of the involved users.</p>

    <h2>A message to students:</h2>
    <p> As current and former students, the Chegg team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates. That being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward. Copying solutions or posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on the Services.</p>

    <h2>A message to educators:</h2>
    <p> We are always seeking opportunities to work with educators in making our Websites a valuable resource for both you and your classroom for years to come. If you need to contact us concerning an issue of academic integrity, please e-mail us at .</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p> Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. The failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Non-performance of either party, except for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party. This "Miscellaneous" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p> Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time (“Updated Terms”). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Chegg Website so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of our Services after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services. It is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes. The updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms of Use, and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p> The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the entire agreement between you and Chegg regarding the Services. The Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative of Chegg, and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them. This "Entire Agreement" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>
