    <p> These Merchant Terms of Use (the Terms) govern your use of the products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities (the Services) provided by BitPay, Inc.

    <h2>1. The Services</h2>
    <p> We are a bitcoin payment processor. We enable you to accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services, and process bitcoin payments that you receive from your customer (Purchaser). We are not a bitcoin exchange, bitcoin wallet, or a place to purchase or sell bitcoin. Our Services are only available to businesses that offer products and/or services for sale or to bona fide charitable organizations that accept donations. By using the Services, you authorize us to act as your agent so we may receive, hold and disburse funds on your behalf and to take any and all actions that we think are necessary to provide the Services and to comply with applicable law. Payment by Purchaser to BitPay will be considered the same as payment made directly to you and will extinguish the Purchaser's outstanding obligation, to the extent of the payment.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>2. Registration</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>2.1 Generally</h2>
    <p> In order to use the Services, you must open a BitPay account. When you open an account, we will ask you for contact information such as your name, phone number, and email address. We will also ask you for information on your business, including your business’s legal name or DBA, registered address, and your company website. The information that you provide at the time of account opening must be accurate and complete and you must inform us in a timely fashion of any changes to such information. We may require additional information from you (including any person signing below or otherwise agreeing to the Terms on behalf of the merchant) to help verify your identity and assess your business risk, such as your date of birth, tax identification number, government-issued identification, or company financial statements. We may also obtain information about you from third parties, such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We have the right to reject your account registration or to later close your BitPay account, if you do not provide us with accurate, complete, and satisfactory information.</p>
    <p> Merchant Tiers. BitPay imposes daily transaction processing limits on merchants. When you register for a BitPay account, you will be required to select the limit (the Tier) that will apply to your BitPay account, and to provide us with the documentation necessary to qualify for that Tier. A description of the Tiers, as well as a list of the documentation required to qualify for each, is available on . For certain industries, BitPay may ask for additional verification documents. We will not begin to process payments on your behalf until we have reviewed the documentation that you provide, in accordance with applicable law. If you wish to change to a Tier with a higher limit, you must provide us with the additional required documentation. We will not approve your request to change Tiers and permit you a greater processing volume unless and until we have reviewed your documentation to our satisfaction. Please also refer to Section 3.1, Daily Transaction Volume Limits.</p>

    </hr>
    <h2>8. Invoices & Settlement</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.1 Invoice Generation and Exchange Rate Guarantee</h2>
    <p> BitPay's hosted invoice UI shall be used. To create an invoice for your Purchaser, you may post a request to BitPay to collect a specific amount in your local currency, such as Dollars or Euros, or in bitcoin. BitPay will pull the exchange rate, where applicable, and provide the bitcoin payment instructions to you for you to display to the Purchaser. We guarantee the exchange rate to you as long as the Purchaser pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created. Invoice timeout information is clearly displayed on each BitPay invoice. While we guarantee the exchange rate as long as the Purchaser pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your local currency or bitcoin, as applicable. For instance, if you ask us to collect USD $150, and the Purchaser sends the bitcoin equivalent in payment within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly USD $150, minus our fee if applicable. We do not, however, guarantee the value of the U.S. dollar.</p>
    <p> An invoice is considered complete by us after the payment has six (6) bitcoin block confirmations. You have the option to inform your Purchaser earlier about the status of the invoice; please note that BitPay is not liable for settling invoices with a payment that never receives six (6) bitcoin block confirmations. BitPay employs techniques to detect payments that are at risk of never receiving six (6) bitcoin block confirmations, however these measures do not completely eliminate the risk associated with unconfirmed payments.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.2 Fees</h2>
    <p> We charge service fees for merchants on our Starter Plan who have processed more than thirty transactions in a month or who have selected our Business or Enterprise plans (“Service Fees”). Merchants paying Service Fees will have these fees offset against their applicable ledger balances. Purchasers are also assessed an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) fee for purchases. In the event the Purchaser requests a refund or the Merchant requests a refund on the Purchaser’s behalf, only the purchase price will be refunded. The UTXO fee is nonrefundable. If a Purchaser would like to learn more about Bitcoin related fees, please visit . We reserve the right to change our fee structure and pricing. Your continued use of the Services after we notify you of any changes in our fees constitutes your acceptance of such change. Current pricing information is provided on the BitPay website at .</p>

    </hr>
    <h2>8.3 Methods of Settlement</h2>
    <p> We will verify the Purchaser’s payments over the Bitcoin peer-to-peer payment network and post the balance to your accounting ledger, according to your preference settings. The debits and credits to your accounting ledger are funds temporarily held by BitPay until settlement to your bank account can take place. You can receive a settlement in your local currency, in bitcoins, or in a mixture of both. You assume volatility risks of the currency in which you choose to settle. For example, if you choose to settle in bitcoins, then you assume the volatility risk of the bitcoin value. DISCLOSURE: While there are also material risks from accepting various forms of payment (such as cash, other fiat currencies, network card payments, other proprietary electronic payments and alternative virtual currency payments including Litecoin and Dogecoin), BitPay is disclosing the following material risks of virtual currency (specifically bitcoin that we service under Section 1 of our Terms of Use).</p>
    <p> Material Risks of Virtual Currency Disclosure Based on 23 NYCCR 200.19:</p>
    <p> (1) Virtual Currency (Bitcoin) is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections;</p>
    <p> (2) legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;</p>
    <p> (3) transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;</p>
    <p> (4) some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction;</p>
    <p> (5) the value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear;</p>
    <p> (6) there is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future;</p>
    <p> (7) the volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time;</p>
    <p> (8) the nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;</p>
    <p> (9) the nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by BitPay may prevent the access or use of a customer’s Virtual Currency; and</p>
    <p> (10) any bond or trust account maintained by BitPay for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.3.1 Settlements in Local Currencies</h2>
    <p> Direct deposit to a bank account in a local currency is available to merchants located in certain countries. Please refer to for a list of those countries. If you wish to receive direct deposit settlements, you must provide us with valid bank account information and keep such information current. If you are using the Business or Enterprise plan, we will send a direct deposit to your bank account to clear out your accumulated ledger balance each business day. If you are using the Starter plan, we will issue payouts to your bank account once weekly. If you are accepting any portion of your settlement in bitcoin, we will issue payouts to your wallet daily. Minimum settlement amounts apply; please refer to for information related to minimum settlement amounts and deposit frequency.</p>

    <p> https://bitpay.com/docs/settlement</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.3.2 Your Bank Account</h2>
    <p> You must provide us with written notice at least one (1) business day prior to closing your bank account. If you wish to continue to receive direct deposits, you must provide us with information for a substitute bank account. You are solely liable for all fees and costs associated with your bank account and for all overdrafts. You are also liable to us for any fees that we may incur based on your provision of inaccurate information or instructions. You authorize us to initiate electronic credits to your bank account at any time, as necessary to process your transactions. We will not be liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in bank account entries caused by third parties.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.3.3 Settlements in Bitcoins</h2>
    <p> Any bitcoin accepted by BitPay on your behalf must be settled to a bitcoin wallet selected by you. Payments in bitcoins are sent to your designated Bitcoin address, at least once per calendar day. BitPay is not liable for any losses incurred as a result of improperly reported or designated bitcoin addresses you.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.4 Payment Exceptions</h2>
    <p> In certain situations when an invoice is not fully paid or overpaid, it will result in a payment exception. As the merchant, it is your responsibility to decision these payment exceptions.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.4.1 Underpayments</h2>
    <p> Underpayments occur when the Purchaser sends less than the full bitcoin amount required to mark the invoice as fully paid. Since the invoice is not fully paid or complete, the funds do not get applied to the merchant ledger. It is the merchant’s responsibility to reach out to BitPay and request that we either adjust the price of the invoice to match the payment amount, which will allow the payment to be applied and credited to the ledger, or provide the Purchaser’s refund bitcoin address so that we may return the funds. If neither of these steps are taken, the invoice will stay in a partially paid state until completed.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.4.2 Overpayments</h2>
    <p> Overpayments occur when an invoice receives excess funds. In cases such as this, this invoice passes through the state of being paid in full and is marked as an overpayment. Since there were enough funds to mark the invoice as paid in full, those funds are applied to the merchant ledger. However, the excess funds are not applied and require action. As a best practice, we suggest that you reach out to the Purchaser to obtain a refund bitcoin address and request that BitPay refund the overpaid funds to the Purchaser. The Purchaser also has the ability to request a refund of the overpaid portion of the payment directly from the invoice. As the merchant, you also have the ability to request that the overpaid portion of the payment be applied to your merchant account, typically in cases where you are providing a trackable service and the additional funds can be easily refunded to the Purchaser.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.4.3 Orphan Payment</h2>
    <p> occur when a transaction is received outside the time window referenced in Section 8.1 (Invoice Generation and Exchange Rate Guarantee). Any payments sent to the expired bitcoin address will show up in BitPay’s system as an orphan payment. For more information or to resolve orphaned payments, either you or the Purchaser will need to reach out to with the appropriate information.</p>

    <h2>8.5 Certain Deferrals</h2>
    <p> If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your BitPay account, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds while we do so. Additionally, we may delay settlement or restrict access to your funds if required to do so by law, court order or at the request of law enforcement.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>8.6 Account Information</h2>
    <p> You will have access to account information detailing your ledger and transaction and settlement history through your merchant account. Should you identify an error, you must notify us within thirty (30) calendar days of the ledger entry posting.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>9. Refunds and Adjustments</h2>
    </hr>
    <h2>9.1 Refund Procedures</h2>
    <p> BitPay can facilitate refunds on your behalf. You can decide to issue a partial refund or refund the full amount of the initial purchase. You can also decide whether to issue the refund in your local currency or in bitcoins. If you do not have enough funds in your BitPay account to cover the refund, BitPay may require you to deposit bitcoins or fiat to BitPay to cover the refund to the Purchaser. Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by BitPay, following the guidelines found here: .</p>
    <p> https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-exchange-rates</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>9.1.1 Refund of Payment Exceptions</h2>
    <p> If a payment exception is not refunded by you within 30 days after the invoice creation date, you will only be able to refund (and not accept) the payment exception and BitPay will lock the BTC/USD exchange rate exactly 30 days after the date and time of invoice creation. For any refunds of payment exceptions that occur after this 30 day window, the locked exchange rate is used to determine the amount of bitcoin that will be refunded. Any refunds of payment exceptions that happen prior to this 30 day window will be refunded in the exact amount of BTC originally received.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>9.2 Disclosure of Your Refund Policy</h2>
    <p> BitPay is not responsible for Merchant refund policies. We do suggest Merchants have a clear refund policy for their customers (including, if applicable, “no refunds are allowed as all sales are final”). If refunds are permitted, we recommend you refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>9.3 Purchaser Complaints</h2>
    <p> Purchasers filing complaints with BitPay about a purchase will be forwarded to you for resolution. BitPay reserves the right to terminate accounts which receive excessive complaints.</p>
