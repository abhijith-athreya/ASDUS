    </hr>
    <h2>Social Media Sharing</h2>
    <p> ALLNURSES.COM is a public site and is indexed by Google and other Search Engines on a daily basis. If there is something you are concerned about being public knowledge, you should not be posting it on ALLNURSES.COM or anywhere online.</p>
    <p> We occasionally share posts from ALLNURSES.COM on our Facebook page(s). No personal details are shared. What we share is publicly available on ALLNURSES.COM. We share the link to the page, any image found on the page, and a brief context from the page.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Posting Information:</h2>
    <p> Although the Constitution of the US guarantees that “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech”, ALLNURSES.COM, INC is not Congress. Freedom of speech rights do not extend to ALLNURSES.COM, INC. This Terms of Service (Guidelines) governs the behaviors and activities of the members. If you choose not to follow the guidelines agreed to during registration, the result is disabling your account.</p>
    <p> You are not allowed to post libelous information about a person, school, instructor, health care facility, or entity. Any post which is violative of any law or is invasive of a person's privacy will be taken down immediately.</p>
    <p> We promote the idea of lively debate. This means you are free to disagree with anyone on any type of subject matter as long as your criticism is constructive and polite. Additionally, please refrain from name-calling. This is divisive, rude, and derails the thread.</p>
    <p> Our first priority is to the members that have come here because of the flame-free atmosphere we provide. There is a zero-tolerance policy here against personal attacks. We will not tolerate anyone insulting other's opinion nor name calling.</p>
    <p> Our call is to be supportive, not divisive. Because of this, discrimination, racial vilification and offensive generalizations targeting people of other races, religions and/or nationalities, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Foul Language / Profanity:</h2>
    <p> Nothing should ever be posted here that you would not say in front of a crowd of professionals. ALLNURSES.COM, INC. staff have the right to edit offensive language. (Including profanity cleverly disguised - such as different spelling or a mixture of letters and symbols.)</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Information About Others:</h2>
    <p> No potentially libelous information about specific schools, instructors, or health care facilities/entities should be posted in these forums. While it is important to be able to network, everyone should be mindful of the following:</p>
    <p> It is a small world - when we narrow it down to a state and throw in some personal info, there is actually a pretty good chance someone may recognize you if you are not careful. Your privacy is paramount to us.</p>
    <p> While this site is a wonderful place to vent (without excess personally identifiable details) it is not the place to express why ("x" specific person, place or program) is terrible. Gripe away, but since we cannot permit allegations to be made about named entities, your care in not naming them is very much appreciated.</p>
    <p> Please do not give out personal identifying information about yourself or others. Do not name names where anyone could identify any person in any facility including your nursing programs or place of employment.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Advertising / Self Promotion:</h2>
    <p> Please do not post any messages anywhere on this site that are primarily for the promotion or advertising of any website, email address, forum, business, MLM, activity, personal blogs, or other entities with which you have an affiliation including non-profit sites (ie. no self-promotion).</p>
    <p> We do not allow any form of commercial advertising in the bulletin board post, avatars, signatures, or user names. This includes using your avatar or signature to link to other websites or promotional messages that are advertising in nature. Please note, this includes links to political parties’ websites.</p>
    <p> You may not post items to sell, purchase, or rent, including books, school supplies, uniforms, or any form of real estate.</p>
    <p> You may not invite, solicit or coerce others to join other community websites through posts, email, PM, use of ALLNURSES.COM, INC. membership list or any other resource within the ALLNURSES.COM, INC. We allow linking to other information websites, as long as it is for informational purposes and not for self promotion advertisement. Staff members may remove or edit links at their discretion.</p>
