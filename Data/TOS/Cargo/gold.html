    <h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>
    <p> The Service is web-based and allows users that register for an account on the Service (an "Account Holder") to create and update an online web site on Cargocollective.com. Once registered with the Service, each Account Holder receives his or her own Web Site to post "Content" (as such term is defined in Section 7). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Cargo tools and resources, shall be subject to the TOS. In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Cargo, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Cargo Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Cargo membership and you will be able to opt out of receiving them. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interfaces that are provided by Cargo for use in accessing the Service.</p>
