This general policy covers the European Union's family of institutional Web Sites, within the eu domain. Although you can browse through most of these Web Sites without giving any information about yourself, in some cases, personal information is required in order to provide the you request. Web Sites that require such information treat it according to the policy described in the Regulation mentioned above and provide in their specific privacy policy statements.</p>

    </hr>
    <h2>What is an e-service?</h2>
    <p> Three types of e-services are or will be offered by EUROPA:</p>

    <p> Interactive communication services that allow better contacts with citizens, business, civil society and public actors thus facilitating policy consultations, and feedback mechanisms, in order to contribute to the shaping of policies, the activities and the services of the EU;</p>
    <p> Transaction services that allow access to all basic forms of transactions with the EU, e.g. procurement, financial operations, recruitment, event enrolment, acquisition or purchase of documents etc.</p>
    <p> A specific privacy policy statement will contain the following information about the use of your data:</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Information contained in a specific privacy statement.</h2>

    <p> To whom your information is disclosed. The EU will only disclose information to third parties if that is necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose(s) identified above and to the mentioned (categories of) recipients. The EU will not divulge your personal data for direct marketing purposes;</p>
    <p> How you can access your information, verify its accuracy and, if necessary, correct it. As a data subject you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on legitimate compelling grounds except when it is collected in order to comply with a legal obligation, or is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or is to be used for a purpose for which you have given your unambiguous consent;</p>
    <p> How long your data is kept. The EU only keeps the data for the time necessary to fulfil the purpose of collection or further processing;</p>
    <p> What are the security measures taken to safeguard your information against possible misuse or unauthorised access;</p>
    <p> Whom to contact if you have queries or complaints.</p>
    <p> Many web pages on Europa have a "Contact" button, which activates your e-mail software and invites you to send your comments to a specific functional mailbox. When you send such a message, your personal data is collected only to the extent necessary to reply. If the management team of the mailbox is unable to answer your question, it will forward your e-mail to another service. You will be informed, via e-mail, about which service your question has been forwarded to. If you have any questions about the processing of your e-mail and related personal data, do not hesitate to include them in your message.</p>

    <h2>Use of the EU emblem by third parties</h2>
    <p> The principles of use of the European Emblem by third parties have been set out in an administrative agreement with the Council of Europe. This agreement has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 08/09/2012 (2012/C 271/04).</p>
    <p> According to this agreement, any natural or legal person ("third party user") may use the European Emblem or any of its elements, as long as this use</p>
    <p> (a) does not create the impression or assumption that there is a connection between the third party user and any of the institutions, bodies, offices, agencies and organs of the European Union or the Council of Europe where this connection does not exist;</p>
    <p> (b) does not lead the public to believe that the user benefits from the support, sponsorship, approval or consent of any of the institutions, bodies, offices, agencies and organs of the European Union or the Council of Europe where this is not the case;</p>
    <p> (c) is not made in connection with any objective or activity which is incompatible with the aims and principles of the European Union or the Council of Europe, or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
    <p> If the use of the European Emblem complies with the above conditions, there is no need to ask for written permission.</p>
    <p> Registration of the European Emblem, or a heraldic imitation thereof, as a trade mark or as any other IP right is not acceptable.</p>
