    <p> Terms and Conditions for our website</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> Kaiser Permanente provides two websites: (1) , and (2) a mobile-enabled website, which may be accessed through a KP Mobile Application ("KP Mobile Application") or through a mobile Web browser. These websites (the "Websites") allow users to:</p>
    <p> "kaiserpermanente.org" or "kp.org"</p>
    <p> view health-related information</p>
    <p> communicate with our practitioners and our staff</p>
    <p> arrange for clinical and health plan services</p>
    <p> access additional services</p>
    <p> The information provided on the Websites is not a substitute for the advice of a personal physician or other qualified health care professional. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional with any questions regarding medical symptoms or a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Websites.</p>
    <p> If you think you or someone you are taking care of has a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Agreement</h2>
    <p> BY USING THE WEBSITES OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" BELOW, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITES.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Using secure messaging</h2>
    <p> Kaiser Permanente provides users with a number of interactive online services to help them better communicate with our practitioners and staff. These services may include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <p> secure messaging, including:</p>
    <p> email the doctor's office</p>
    <p> ask a pharmacist</p>
    <p> appointment requests</p>
    <p> You agree that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type (including secure messaging) that infringe upon, misappropriate or violate any rights of any party.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Viewing medical records</h2>
    <p> Users may use the Websites to view certain information displayed from their medical records, including the results of certain laboratory tests. Using the lab test result feature is considered to be a request to receive lab test results online or on a mobile device.</p>
    <p> Users may also authorize other users of the Websites to view health information displayed on the website through the "Act for a Family Member" feature. If you are authorized to access another user's health information, you agree to protect the confidentiality of this information and comply with state and federal privacy laws that may prohibit the redisclosure of health information without the express written authorization of the person who is the subject of the health information, including but not limited to federal law prohibiting the redisclosure of health information regarding alcohol and drug abuse referral and treatment.</p>
    <p> In addition, although the Websites display certain information in medical records, they do not necessarily display all information found in those medical records. If you think that medical record information displayed on the Websites is inaccurate, you can request Kaiser Permanente to amend the medical record by mailing a request to the department identified in your regional Notice of Privacy Practices. (A link to the Regional Notice of Privacy Practices is available at the bottom of each page on our website, kp.org.) To request a complete copy of a medical record, please contact the department identified in your regional Notice of Privacy Practices responsible for providing records.</p>
    <p> Any personal information you submit to the Websites (for yourself or someone else) is governed by our Website and KP Mobile Application Privacy Statement. (A link to our privacy practices is available at the bottom of each page on our Websites and on the "More" screen at the bottom of the KP Mobile Application.) This includes information on your rights to see and receive copies of your own or others' personal health information.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>KP Mobile Application: “Jailbreaking” the mobile operating system</h2>
    <p> The KP Mobile Application is intended for use only on a mobile device that is running an unmodified manufacturer-approved operating system. Using the KP Mobile Application on a device with a modified operating system may undermine security features that are intended to protect health information from unauthorized or unintended disclosure. You may compromise your health information or the health information of anyone for whom you have been given access, if you use the KP Mobile Application on a mobile device that has been modified. Use of the KP Mobile Application on a mobile device with a modified operating system is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Passwords</h2>
    <p> Kaiser Permanente has several tools that allow you to record and store information. You are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your Kaiser Permanente online password or account. It is your sole responsibility to (1) control the disclosure and use of your activation codes, password reset codes and password; (2) authorize, monitor, and control access to and use of your Kaiser Permanente online account and password; and (3) promptly change your password if you feel it has become compromised; and (4) promptly inform the kp.org Web manager of any need to deactivate an account entirely.</p>
    <p> To change your password, sign on and choose the arrow icon next to your name at the top of the page. Then, select Profile and Preferences. To deactivate your account, you may Contact our Site Manager using the link available at the bottom of each kp.org web page. If you're using a mobile device and would like to change your password or deactivate your account, please go to kp.org and follow the above steps.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Breaches of these Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p> In consideration of being allowed to use the Websites' interactive services, you agree that the following actions shall constitute a material breach of these Terms and Conditions:</p>
    <p> signing on as or pretending to be another person (Note: this does not restrict authorized use of the "Act for a Family Member" feature on the Websites.)</p>
    <p> using secure messaging for any purpose in violation of local, state, national, international laws or posted Kaiser Permanente policies</p>
    <p> transmitting material that infringes or violates the intellectual property rights of others or the privacy or publicity rights of others</p>
    <p> transmitting material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, predatory of minors, threatening, harassing, abusive, slanderous, or hateful to any person (including Kaiser Permanente personnel) or entity as determined by Kaiser Permanente in its sole discretion</p>
    <p> using interactive services in a way that is intended to harm, or a reasonable person would understand would likely result in harm, to the user or others</p>
    <p> collecting information about others, including email addresses</p>
    <p> intentionally distributing viruses or other harmful computer code</p>
    <p> "Jailbreaking" the operating system of a mobile device using the KP Mobile Application</p>
    <p> Kaiser Permanente expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate a user's access to any interactive services and/or to any or all other areas of the Websites due to any act that would constitute a violation of these Terms and Conditions. To the extent there is an inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions and the Website and KP Mobile Application Privacy Statement, these Terms and Conditions shall govern.</p>
    </hr>
    <h2>Communications by email</h2>
    <p> By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you agree to receive essential communications by email. These communications may include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <p> notification that an important message awaits you on the Websites (this may be a message from a doctor, a new lab test result, an appointment confirmation, a response from a pharmacist, etc.)</p>
    <p> kp.org, m.kp.org, and KP Mobile Application site & service updates</p>
    <p> emergency alerts and critical messages (for example, if a snowstorm or wildfire has temporarily closed a medical center)</p>
    <p> general health communications from Kaiser Permanente providers</p>
    <p> While you have Kaiser Permanente coverage, you may receive the monthly wellness update by email as part of your essential communications and services. You may choose to receive this communication by mail instead. In addition, you may periodically receive online invitations to participate in member satisfaction and other types of surveys related to your experiences at Kaiser Permanente. Your participation in such surveys is always optional.</p>
    <p> Partners in Health</p>
    <p> Beginning in April, 2017, if you forget your kp.org password, in addition to other methods for resetting your password, you will now be able to choose to have a one-time password reset code sent to the email address you provided to us when you registered for kp.org. Because we are adding this new password reset method, if you are using a shared email address, you may want to change it to protect your privacy. To update your email address, sign on to kp.org and choose the arrow icon next to your name at the top of the page. Then, select Profile and Preferences.</p>
    </hr>
